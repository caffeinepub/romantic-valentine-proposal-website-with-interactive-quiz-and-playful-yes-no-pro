# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the revealed hidden button’s label (shown after the “No” button cracks/falls) to playful English text while preserving all existing interactions and celebration flow.

**Planned changes:**
- Change only the user-facing label text of the hidden revealed button to English (playful tone; emojis allowed).
- Ensure the revealed hidden button remains clickable and visually distinct, and triggers the exact same success/celebration behavior as the main “Yes” button (confetti + floating hearts + existing success screen/message).
- Verify the revealed hidden button stays within the visible proposal area and remains clickable on desktop and mobile (no z-index/pointer-events issues).

**User-visible outcome:** After the “No” button cracks/falls, the newly revealed button shows an English playful label, and tapping/clicking it celebrates and navigates to the same success message as choosing “Yes.”
