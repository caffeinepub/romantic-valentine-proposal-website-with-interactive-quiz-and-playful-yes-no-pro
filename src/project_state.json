    "Ensure the No button repulsion/dodge logic respects viewport boundaries and supports both pointer (mouse) and touch inputs.",
    "Use smooth transitions/animations between quiz and proposal screens for a playful, romantic feel.",

    "No-button click edge case: if user clicks No, play crack/break/fall animation then swap/replace with a revealed hidden Yes button beneath; ensure revealed button is clickable (z-index/pointer-events) and triggers the same celebration flow as main Yes.",
